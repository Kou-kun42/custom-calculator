# 3D Printing Filament Calculator

This calculator helps you quickly figure out how much a print will cost.  Start by inputting the cost of your filament spool as well the weight of filament it originally had.  Then either change the weight or length of your estimated print using the values given from your slicer.  You can change any of the variables and the calculator will automatically correct the corresponding values to match.  Changing the filament color only affects the aesthetic of the website and has no impact on the calculations.

Enjoy!
